# README #

Create a three page website, using html, css, and javascript.

First page is bio, and contains links to the two other pages.

Second page is a short write-up on what aspect(s) of the Michigan Daily website you think can be improved.

Third page is your playground. Create interactive dataviz, embed videos or images, mess with html, css, or javascript, or anything else. Just have fun and experiment.

Upload the pages and all associated files and create a pull request to the tmd directory.
